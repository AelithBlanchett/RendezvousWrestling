#TODO
- Add ModifierFactory to the list of generics :(
- Rework game settings so they can be overrided
- Use the factories to create the features, modifiers, actions. For modifiers, make sure to use the ReceivedModifiers and ApplyingModifiers
- Make sure features, modifiers and actions are correctly instanciated and working with the new types
- Review IDs of all entities
- Implement all the actions/features/modifiers
